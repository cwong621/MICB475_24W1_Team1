# MICB475_24W1_Team1


## Monday Sep 23 - prep for team meeting 1
Potential ideas for project 2
1. Comparing gut microbiome in MS patients and ILD patients (halfvarson dataset) -> using existing datasets
   - must have a couple categories in common to compare
   - maybe nutritional correlation with MS
3. Comparing micrbiome of HIV+ mothers and infants -> find our own dataset
4. IVF infancy
5. Use lung microbiome database from ILD patients, compare to vaping/smoking, pre-existing illnesses that makes patients vulnerable to cystic fibrosis --> find our own dataset
